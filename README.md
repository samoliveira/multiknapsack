_____________________________________________________
## Tests
the tests are at: 
http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/files/
and they are the files below: 
mknap1.txt, mknap2.txt, mknapcb1.txt ate mknapcb9.txt

*this code only supports the files mknapcb1,mknapcb2,...,mknapcb9

## Pre-requisites & Installing
- make sure you have IBM ILOG installed in your machine and the python interface for CPLEX.
- Python3
- clone this repo
## Running
```python solver.py [test_name]```


- It will generate a file called test_name_sol.txt in the same directory of the test file.
